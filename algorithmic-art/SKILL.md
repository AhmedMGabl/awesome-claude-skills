## Instructions for Creating Algorithmic Art

### Step 1: Understand the Request
- Determine which technique fits best (fractals, particles, patterns, etc.)
- Clarify desired output format (PNG, SVG, GIF, interactive HTML)
- Identify parameters: size, colors, iterations, complexity

### Step 2: Select Implementation Method
- Choose appropriate language and libraries
- Consider output quality requirements
- Plan for performance (number of iterations, image size)

### Step 3: Generate the Art
- Implement the algorithm with clear, well-commented code
- Use parameters that create visually interesting results
- Apply color schemes that enhance the visual appeal
- Optimize for the requested output size and quality

### Step 4: Export and Present
- Save in requested format (PNG, SVG, PDF, HTML)
- Provide the generated artwork
- Include the source code for reproducibility
- Explain the algorithm and parameters used

## Color Palette Recommendations

- **Monochrome**: Single hue with varying lightness/saturation
- **Gradient**: Smooth transitions (rainbow, sunset, ocean)
- **Complementary**: Opposite colors on color wheel
- **Analogous**: Adjacent colors for harmony
- **Golden Ratio**: Colors spaced by φ (1.618) on hue wheel
- **Natural**: Earth tones, botanical greens, ocean blues

## Best Practices

1. **Start Simple**: Begin with basic parameters, then increase complexity
2. **Make it Interactive**: Allow parameter adjustment when creating web-based art
3. **Document Parameters**: Explain what each parameter controls
4. **Optimize Performance**: Balance visual quality with computational cost
5. **Aesthetic Choices**: Consider composition, color, and visual balance
6. **Reproducibility**: Include random seed for consistent regeneration
7. **High Resolution**: Generate at sufficient resolution for intended use
8. **Export Options**: Provide multiple format options when appropriate

## Example Prompts

**Fractal Art**:
```

rainbow color gradient
```

**Generative Pattern**:
```
Generate a Voronoi diagram with 50 random points, colored using a sunset 
gradient from orange to purple
```

**Particle System**:
```
Create a flow field visualization with 2000 particles following Perlin 
noise, export as animated GIF
```

**L-System**:
```
Generate a fractal tree using an L-system with 7 iterations, make it look 
organic and natural
```

**Cellular Automaton**:
```

## Tips for Amazing Results

1. **Experiment with Parameters**: Small changes can create dramatically different results
2. **Use Symmetry**: Mirror, radial, or translational symmetry often looks beautiful
3. **Layer Complexity**: Combine multiple techniques (e.g., Perlin noise + particles)
4. **Post-Processing**: Apply filters, blur, or color adjustments for polish
5. **Resolution Matters**: Generate at 2x-4x intended display size for crisp results
6. **Save Your Seeds**: Keep random seeds to recreate favorite results
7. **Study Nature**: Natural patterns inspire algorithmic art (spirals, branching, cells)
8. **Embrace Randomness**: Controlled randomness creates organic, interesting results
