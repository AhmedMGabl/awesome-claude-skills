Hey Hany! 👋

Quick question - can you try asking Claude Code this:
"List my Render services"

If it works, you already have Render MCP access! 🎉

We're using the same account, so you might already have everything set up.

If it works, I've prepared a complete guide showing you what you can do with Render MCP:
• Create/deploy web services
• Create databases (PostgreSQL, Redis)
• Monitor logs and metrics
• Manage environment variables

Check out these files in the awesome-claude-skills folder:
📄 render-mcp-guide.md - Full guide with all tools and examples
📄 message-for-hany.md - Quick reference

If it DOESN'T work, let me know and I'll help you set it up (takes 5 mins).

Try it and let me know! 🚀
